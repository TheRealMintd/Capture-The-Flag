How To Play
===========

There are several gamemodes available in _CTF: TVOS_.
Gamemodes available are:

**Basics**<br>
Each team starts off with 5 pieces and a die.<br>
Turns are taken in alternating order. e.g. Red Team Player 1, Blue Team Player 1, Red Team Player 2, Blue Team Player 2 and so on.

**Cards**<br>
Every 3 turns, both teams get to draw one card from the card pile and deposit it into their team's card pile.

There are two types of cards: Suprise and Strategic<br>
Suprise cards take effect immediately after drawing them from the deck.<br>
Strategic cards take effect when you play them. They can be played on your team's turn.

Refer to [CARDS.md](https://github.com/petster101/Capture-The-Flag/blob/master/Rules/CARDS.md) for a list of cards.

**Movement**<br>
Movement can only happen on your turn. To move, roll a die and choose a direction to move in. You can move diagonally, horizontally, and vertically. You can move forward as well as backward.

**Combat**<br>
To start a battle, you will need to land on the same space as your opponent. This will start a dice battle between the two.

The winner is the person that rolls the highest number.

**Winning**<br>
To win a game of CTF: TVOS one of the teams has to capture the enemy's flag and bring it to thier base.
