How To Play
===========

There are several gamemodes available in _CTF: TVOS_.
Gamemodes available are:

**Basics**

Each team starts off with 5 pieces and a die.<br>
Turns are taken in alternating order. e.g. Red Team Player 1, Blue Team Player 1, Red Team Player 2, Blue Team Player 2 and so on.

**Cards**

Every 3 turns, both teams get to draw one card from the card pile and deposit it into their team's card pile.

Cards can only be played on the team's turn.

Refer to [CARDS.md](https://github.com/petster101/Capture-The-Flag/blob/master/Rules/CARDS.md) for a list of cards.
