How To Play
===========

There are several gamemodes available in _CTF: TVOS_.
Gamemodes available are:

Basics
------
Each team starts off with 5 pieces and a die. *Optional: Teams start up with 20 pieces each.*<br>
Turns are taken in alternating order. e.g. Red Team, Blue Team, Red Team and so on.

Cards
-----
Every 5 turns, both teams get to draw one card from the card pile and deposit it into their team's card pile.

There are two types of cards: Surprise and Strategic<br>
Surprise cards take effect immediately after drawing them from the deck.<br>
Strategic cards only take effect when you play them down from your team's card pile. They can be played on your team's turn.

Refer to [CARDS.md](https://github.com/petster101/Capture-The-Flag/blob/master/Rules/CARDS.md) for a list of cards.

Movement
--------
Every turn, your whole team gets to roll the dice to move. You can move in any direction from the tile you are standing on.
The number you roll is the amount of steps you take from your current point.

Combat
------
To start a battle, you will need to land on the same space as your opponent. This will start a dice battle between the two. One player from each team takes a die and roll it. The team which rolls the higher number with the die wins the dice battle.

If you lose, you will respawn back at your base.

The outcome of the dice battle can be altered by playing cards. Refer to [CARDS.md](https://github.com/petster101/Capture-The-Flag/blob/master/Rules/CARDS.md)

Winning
-------
To win a game of CTF: TVOS one of the teams has to capture the enemy's flag and bring it to thier base.
