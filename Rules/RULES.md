Rules
=====
These are the rules for the game _Capture The Flag: The Volcano of Swag_.

The following are main categories:

Combat
In Combat, each player rolls their dice and whoever rolls the higher number wins the battle. Cards can be played to manipulate combat at certain times.

Movement
Every turn, your whole teams gets to roll the dice to move. You can move in any direction from the tile you are standing on.
The number you roll is the amount of steps you take from your current point.

Cards
Every 5 turns, both teams get to draw one card from the deck to use in their favour or to keep in their hand. At times the card may be a Surprise card and thus the team on that turn currently have no choice but to use it.

When you have lost in a battle you will respawn back at your base.

Read all the instructions of a card carefully.

NO CHEATING!

HAVE FUN!
